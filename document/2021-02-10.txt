            # right Join
            # Full Join

* Done Complete prcatice in both the way using GUI and Query.
* Done Some Observations and Experiments and Noted Down result like

  1. What if we Set "Set Default" in Insert and Update Specification of Relationship (Foreign Key) without any default value
     Observation: it works as "Set Null" options means replace the value by null.

  2. What is Indentity is set and insert query gives error
    Observation : 
        1. If It is at Compile stage means invalid name of table or column then work smoothly
        2. But if Error at run time like wrong value then it will increment counter of identity means
            Ex 
            a. If Last Sucessful Inserted is at Identity "10"
            b. Any Errorneous(Logical) insert is happened then as incremented the counter by "11" but record is not Inserted
            c. So when Successful entry take place it store with identity "12" not "11"
