* Gone Through the all concepts and try to corelate them for relatime application
* Done Practice of few confusing concept and get more idea of them like
    1. Custom Attribute 
        - How to Give Property Value While Declaring Attribute
        - We can not Declare value which may change at compilte time like if Date Is there then can not assign value like DateTime.Now.ToLongDateString() 
          as it given new value.
    2. Threding and Locking
        - Build One Application Named (CompletePractice2) based on that defination of that is 
            " Register Number and Calling to Other Register Person, on call time both user are bussy for 10secs
              While on call user can not not call other person if try then proper message and
              if user is busy then if other user call to any of two who are connected then it not accept the call and tell user that person is busy."
        - Used the locking and try to manage that locking in best possible way.
        - To Maintain Details of User used Dictionary and also used Dictionary to maintain list of user who are connected and who were connected and used flag to check user is 
           available or not.
        - To get more understanding of threding using breakpoint and Diagonsis Tool (Events).
    3. Got Brief Idea about Mutex and Semaphore no doubt it is not benificial in case of internal threding so try to find about External Threding.  
        
        # Got New thing that we can not Use valuetype variable as in lock object can use reference type variables or reference only.
* Also Revised consepts like ValueTuple and Tuple.
