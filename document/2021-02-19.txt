* Done practice of all the concepts as much as possible way like
  - Choose function inside IIF to sure that if user enter index which is not contain by choose function then can handle that.
  - Dynamic Sql Query Using Choose Function.
  - Also While Exeperiment Got the  thing which may I Miss that When We use Select * into tblname from tblname where 1 <> 2 to copy structure of table then only
    got columns only not a constraint or indexes or any things which is particular for table.

* Got Difference Between Delete and Truncate in terms of Identity when data got delete, Got That
  - When We Delete Identity Not Get Reset where as in case of truncate along with data identity got reset too.
