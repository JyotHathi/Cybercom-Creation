                    Angular (Ngrx)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Started Exploring about NgRx from Official Website and from Videos.
* Got Basic Idea that what is Store, Action, Reducer and how it is working in NgRx
* Also From Video Tutorial created small counter application in which 
    -> counter value is in store, increment, Decrement and Reset are Action and created Reducer based on that.
    -> Then Registered Reducer in app.module
    -> Then injected Store in Counter Component and from that retrieve the value and with components methods which handling event 
    call then bind actions accordingly using dispatch method.
* Fro That Got basic idea and also explored more things regarding same.
