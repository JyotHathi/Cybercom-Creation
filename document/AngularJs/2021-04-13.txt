* Gone through TypeScript Videos and Got idea that what is TypeScript and How we can create code using TypeScript.
* So After gone through TypeScript I can Say TypeScript is like c# in dotnet framework means coding language which helps us to code.
* In TypeScript gone through many concepts like
  - Data Types
  - How to declare any variable with particular type
  - Assertion 
  - classes
  - interface
  - enums
  - Generic function & classes
  - Arrow function
  - How to make parameter optional in function or constructor
  - Looping, Conditional Statements, Switch Statement
  - Namespace and Modules: What is Use, What is Difference and Whats the need of that
* Gone Through the Videos of Blocks of Angular Application like Component, Module.
* Got Basic Idea of those that Component is like Small Part of Angular Application whereas module is Group of Component.
* How to Create Component from CLI and manually using decorators and Register in Module, and Got Idea about Component like
  - Basically it has logic + Data and Front End Code which are use to display any small block or area which is Known as component.
  - Generally Logic, Code, Data is Separated in to different files like .component.html, .component.ts, .component.css. 
* What is Service and what is use of that, why we use dependency injection and if we use dependency injection we need to add that in provider 
  list or of Module.
