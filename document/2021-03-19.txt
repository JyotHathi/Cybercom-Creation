                          ASP.net MVC

* Gone Through all the videoes which mainly covers concepts like
    - Different types of Filters are in MVC
    - OutputCache Action Filter Which is Use to Cache The Action Methods's Output which helps to improve performance 
    - Handle Error Attribute which is use to Handle Unhandked Exception or Error, default Error Page and Custom Error Page
    - In Authentication Forms Authentication and Roll Management To Ristrict The User Access and Define Level of Access by User types
    - AllowHtmlAttribute and ValidateInput Attribute to allow wether allowing HTML input or Not , or Want to Validate the Input or Not

* Got idea that How to Divide whole project by role wise which is very helpful so that We can restrict anonymous Access of Sources from Not Authorized Users.
* How we can use Caching So that It Improve the performance of System but need to tack care in case of Both Authentication and Authentication and Caching 
  otherwise it may lead to great trouble for example If On Global Level Stoping Access of all resources but we need to allow login page and basic information 
  providing page without any aceess checking which is best.
