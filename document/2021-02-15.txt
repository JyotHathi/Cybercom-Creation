* Gone Through the all videoes of today which covers
    -> What is Indexed View and Where It is usefull mainly like in OLAP.
    -> What is Triggers, Types of triggers and where it is useful like main thing is if we want to allow view to update, insert and delete 4
       (In Case of Multiple Table Affection as it throw an error).
    -> What is Pivoting and What is Need of that.
    -> Different ways of Derived Tables like
        1. Using View
        2. Using table Variable
        3. Using CTE (Common Table Expression)
        4. Temporary Table
        5. Intermediate Table which get data from select query and can perfrom operations on that and print that just like Sub Query.
    -> Different Things which we can Perform Using CTE using CTE Recursion.

* Done Practice of Concepts and While got idea that I guess We Cant Not Create Triggers for Function Value Expression.
* Also Try To Resolve one of my project's module Time Table Creation using Dervied Table and Pivoting using two tables as a practice.
