* Done Practice of all concepts and also More Idea or Rollup and Cube
 # like Rollup Gives Data like if 3 colmuns are passed then 3, 2-ALL, 1-ALL-ALL, 0-ALL-ALL-ALL
   where as Cube Gives Data of Every Possiblity like if same 3 columns are passed then 3, 2-> - - ALL,2->ALL - -,2->- All - ,1-> - ALL ALL, 0->ALL-ALL-ALL, ......
    So Cube Gives More Data

* Also While Perfroming DDL Trigger Observe That DDL triggers not applicable for temp (Local or Global) table if we have created trigger for create, alter and drop
  though we can perfrom any operation on temp tables.
