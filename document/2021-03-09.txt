* Created Application Using Google recaptcha V2 Check Box inclding
  - Database from XML
  - Validation That User Checked Captcha or Not If Not Then First Tell To Checked
    # Got Idea That We Need to Call Google API to check Whether User Checked or Not 
    # For That Created The Class Which is According Google's API Response Object
    # Deserialize That Object And Check Whether User Checked Or Not

* Also Done Practice of Generic Handler
  - From Calling of Google API for Captcha Response try to call According That and Successfully Called Generic Handler From Backend
  - Also Got Idea That How We Can Store and Get Data of Response so Applied that and Check User is Enter Proper Credentials or not 
    (Got Idea From same Google API Calling and Checking To Check Captcha Response).
  - So Finally Can Successfully Called ANd Get Response From Generic Handler.

* Created Small Login App Which Has Captcha Control with validations of Bith Data and Captcha, Using XMl DataFile as Database, and To Verfiy that User exists or Not
  Used Generic Handler Which Gives Response as True If User and if Not Then False.
