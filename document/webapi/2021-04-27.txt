                    Asp .net Web API
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Gone through with videos of Asp .net web api which covers
  - How to Allow other domain and web to access (Cross Access)
  - What error can occur in case of cross domain access of API
  - How to add Authentication to restrict access of API
  - Use Identity (Individual User which is builtin of microsoft) just like we have userId and password
* Got the concept properly and done practice of that but as little bit tricky need more practice of that so will do tomorrow too before
  starting new concepts from video.
* Also got basic idea that how secure and restrict API (likes whether and many more) works and how to develop that.
