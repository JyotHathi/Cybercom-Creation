                        JavaScript
------------------------------------------------------------------

* COmpleted All Videoes of the day.
* Clear More Idea about Firstclass function that
    - Function Can Return Function too.
        # Main Concept in this is closure means main / called function is got over after return the value but still if there are any object / variables are accessible
          because variable object is present it not get over.

* Alos Gone Through IIFE (Intermediate Invoke Function Expression) 
    - which is not manually invokable
    - When JS code is parsing parser at that time IIFE get execute.

* After also gone through ES6 and diff between ES5 and ES6
    - Can Create Class and Inherite like other OOP just with small different way
    - Can Create Static function which not call by object by Class only.
    - New Array function
    - New String Function
    - let and const kewords and scopes.
