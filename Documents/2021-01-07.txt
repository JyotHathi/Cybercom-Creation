--> What is .gitignore and what is Use of that.

        * .gitignore file is use to ignore list of files or folders from version control.
        * Just When We Update .gitignore file then only have to commit and push the changes, other then that we make any changes in list of files or folders that is ignore by git for version control.

--> Also Done Practice of various techniques to Undo Changes (git checkout <hashcode_of_Commit>)
                                                             (git revert <hash_of_commit> for commit, git revert -m 1 <hash_of_commit>)
                                                             (git reset <hash_code> , git reset --hard <hash_of_Commit>)   

--> As Got Few Conflicts while Undoing of commits, so resolved those.
--> Also Try to create few conflicts and resolve those, so basically also done practice of Resolving of conflicts.
--> But Still It take time too solve complex conflicts so practicing on that part as conflict resolving is main part so.
