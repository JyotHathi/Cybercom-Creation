                        Javascript
------------------------------------------------------------------

--> Went Through Videoes.
--> Learnt basic points of JS like DataTYpes in JS  
    * Numeric
    * String
    * Null
    * Undefined
    * Bollean

--> But Generally Declaring var like    
    var <variable_name> =value;
    Here It Automaticlally Identify the Data Type.

--> Also Type Coersion 
 menas
  var var1 ="String";
  var var2=5;
  console.log(var1 + ' '+var2);
  means can print Many DataTypes values.

--> Also can we can strore any type of value after decalring means type conversion
    var var1="String";
        var1=<Numericvalue>;

--> Opeartor Precedence and typeof Opeartor 
    * While Evalution of expression Precedence table is always there as its standard.
    * typeof Opeartor is help to identify datatype of variable_name
    * Ex: typeof("Hello") => string;

--> Also as I have Basic knowledge of function and conditional statements like loops and if else statement so completed all the practice problem too.
