GIT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--> As I already Worked with Git but using Github desktop so first go through the document and check the flow that flow is different or same.
--> As it is almost same that first have to clone then before starting work fetching updates if have then pull accordingly after this process only start the work and as when we done with the task commit the data and push it into the server/hub.
--> Main thing which is differing that using CLI we need to remember commands so after go through the document tried to remember every command with meaning.

--> Basically Today first go through with every command with practice in GIT-BASH,Command Prompt and Linux Terminal and in that I observe that while I cloning with cmd and GIT-BASH git golder is created as hidden folder by default where as when we create using Linux Terminal git is in visible mode by default.
--> Today I go through with Commands 
	
	* To Generate SSH Key (ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "username/email" then cat~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)
	* To Cloning Repository           
		1. With Nick-Name     			     (git clone -o <nickname> git@github.com:<username>/<reponame>.git)
		2. Without Nick Name (Default Name :origin)  (git clone git@github.com:<username>/<reponame>.git)
	* To Get Nick Name of Repository (git remote -v)
	* To Fetch Repoitory (git fetch nickname)
	* To Create Branch (git checkout -b <new_branch_name> nickname/<current_branch_name>)
	* To Check Status (git status <nickname>)
	* To add file (git add <filename>)
	* To Commit (git commit -m "meesage/Description"
	* To push (git push <nickname> <branch_name>)
	* To See Diffrence between file which is not commited yet (git diff <filename>)
	* To Switch branch (git checkout <branch_name>)
	* To Merge The Branch (git merge --no-ff <nickname>/<branch_name which want to merge> 
		Note: Here To Merge First We have to Switch to Parent Branch of branch which we want to merge
	* To Pull (git pull <nickname>)

--> So at the end of day now clear with the flow and commands with use.
--> Observe the common errors and message like
	
	* When We Try to perform git commands on non git repos that get error that now git repository
	* When We merge then at that time it will open file where we can write discription about merging if we want.
	* When Try we fetch when no update is there or try to find diff when no diffrence is there then no output is there.
	* When No File is there then also it gives error.

--> At the End of the day clear with git using CLI, basic commands, flow and now try to find more commands to learn more about git and github.
